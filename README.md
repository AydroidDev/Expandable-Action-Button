# FAB-Toolbar-Example

# How does it work? #

This sample shows transforming of floating action button into a toolbar upon press or from a toolbar upon scroll. The toolbar can contain different items, such as text, buttons, search fields, or any other items that would be useful at hand.

Moreover, this sample has implmentation of FAB animation(fading in and out) when the user scrolls down or upwards.

When the user presses the button, it goes down and inflates another layout which contains all important stuff. You can add listeners and work with inflated layout as with plain `ViewGroup`.

In order to imitate motion of the button, when it goes down or up, I used a curved motion concept, you can check it out in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVGg4zPRHNE).
